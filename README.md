# __HI - LO__

## Welcome to HI - LO!

A text-based number-guessing game in true 80's retro style.

* A number will be randomly generated depending on the chosen difficulty level.
* The goal is to guess the number in as few tries as possible, with the help
  of 'higher-than' and 'lower-than' hints.
* If the player manage to guess the correct number in few enough tries they
  will be rewarded with some classic ASCII-art.
